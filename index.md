# Introduction
The <font class="dragon_font">Dragon</font>Connect project demonstrates
recording events originating from the
<font class="dragon_font">Dragon</font>Board and managing an LED.
The events are generated by pressing
the volume up and volume down keys on the
<font class="dragon_font">Dragon</font>Board.  When one of the
buttons is pressed, a client application written using the Amazon IoT C SDK
for embedded platforms uses MQTT to transfer the event to an Amazon data
center where it is stored in a DynamoDB table.

The LED is managed through the General Purpose IO (GPIO) of the
<font class="dragon_font">Dragon</font>Board and uses AWS IoT Device Shadows.

The functionality of <font class="dragon_font">Dragon</font>Connect is examined,
followed by detailed documentation of how to configure the application.  The
last section includes information on how to execute the client and visit the
dashboard.
